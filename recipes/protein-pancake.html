    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup low-fat milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Stir flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk cottage cheese, milk, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl. 
            Pour into the flour mixture; whisk until batter is just combined; it will be thick.
        </li>
        <li>
             Heat an oiled griddle over medium-high heat; when a water drop on the surface dances and sizzles, 
             it's ready. Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle. Cook until golden brown and bubbles break the surface, 
             1 to 2 minutes. Turn and cook until set, about 1 minute more. Repeat with remaining batter. 
        </li>
    </ol>
